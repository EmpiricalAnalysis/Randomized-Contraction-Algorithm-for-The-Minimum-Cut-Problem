# Randomized Contraction Algorithm for The Minimum Cut Problem

This is a project I completed while taking "Stanfordx: Algorithms Design And Analysis, Part I" on Coursera. The purpose of this project is to allow students to practice coding up the randomized contraction algorithm for the min cut problem. Students then apply their algorithms to an undirected graph and compute the min cut, i.e., the minimum-possible number of crossing edges.

The java codes I wrote are in the src folder.
